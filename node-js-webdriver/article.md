## Purpose
This guide will give you a jumping off point to start testing your web app with Selenium Webdriver. Webdriver allows you to automate interactions with a website through a browser. The goal is to create a simple script that will navigate through a website and take a screen shot when something goes wrong.

## Setup
We will be using the selenium-webdriver and node filesystem modules in this guide. You can use npm to acquire selenium-webdriver.

`$ npm install selenium-webdriver`

//Add inclusion of Chrome, Safari, and IE

## Create a Driver

## Write a Test
