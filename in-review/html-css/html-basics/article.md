## What is HTML?
---
**HTML is a markup language for describing web documents (web pages).**


* HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
* A markup language is a set of markup tags
* HTML documents are described by HTML tags
* Each HTML tag describes different document content

>A small HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```
---
<br>
### Example Explained
- The ```DOCTYPE``` declaration defines the document type to be HTML
- The text between ```<html> and </html>``` describes an HTML document
- The text between ```<head> and </head>``` provides information about the document
- The text between ```<title> and </title>``` provides a title for the document
- The text between ```<body> and </body>``` describes the visible page content
- The text between ```<h1> and </h1>``` describes a heading
- The text between ```<p> and </p>``` describes a paragraph

## HTML Tags
HTML tags are __keywords__ (tag names) surrounded by __angle brackets__:

     <tagname>content</tagname>
<br>
* HTML tags normally come in pairs like ```<p> and </p>```
* The first tag in a pair is the __start tag__, the second tag is the end tag
* The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a __slash__ before the tag name

## Web Browsers
The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, IE, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them.

The browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document:
