#*What is this?*
First of all let me explain little bit about my self i am working as an Associate Engineer at the moment and yeah this is still my first job.So i got this task to implement the gateway for the plugin i mentioned above.So i asked for support and the answer was you need to write it on your own so with bunch of help from google and people who guided me on various ways i managed to get this done.
#About the code
i've created this gateway option for one of my client and the gateway is not a complete best code still.i am looking forward to update it with features or security measures as much as i can.I studied the Paypal gateway The event Manager team have provided(Thanks a lot guys) and tried to develop the code.Its at the moment working fine(but i am looking forward to more implementations)
