Title: Whizbang projects
Status: published

I respect [Jeff Knupp](http://jefknupp.com) quite a lot.  He's a great
[technical writer](https://www.jeffknupp.com/writing-idiomatic-python-ebook/)
and constantly releases various [awesome](https://github.com/jeffknupp/sandman)
projects.  I can't stress it enough, *you should be reading his blog*.

Especially his newest non-technical posted entitled
[You Need to Start a 'whizbang' Project Immediately](http://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/05/30/you-need-to-start-a-whizbang-project-immediately/).
