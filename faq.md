Welcome!  This is a community for collaborating on creating great technical tutorials.
Our collective aim is by working together, we can educate the world, plus improve our knowledge.
Think of this as a "Wikipedia" for technical tutorials.

### Problems we’re trying to solve

- Technical tutorial blog content is currently created on WordPress, which is universally abhorred by us.
- Once a tutorial is created, it becomes stale and out of date. If the author doesn’t maintain their content, then it becomes less useful.
- There isn’t a strong way for developers to improve their content through peer review.  Wordpress sucks for that.
- Tutorials currently exist in silos.  They live on individual blogs, and are fragmented and varying in quality.  Those tutorials don't typically reach a wide audience since individual blogs have limited reach.
- Tutorials are largely in English and do not translate quickly/easily into other languages since code isn’t easily auto-translated.  Other countries don’t have easy access to learning.

### How we’re solving these problems together

- **We use MarkDown** (rather than WordPress), a simple file format.  This is a really simple text-based file format that takes around 60 seconds to understand.  It's really easy to make things **bold**, _italics_, `code blocks`, etc.  Markdown is used in many places, such as Github README files.  Even this file is a Markdown file.  You can help us edit and improve it.
- **The tutorials are stored in GitHub**, which many developers use daily and love.
- **Use your favorite text editor** to create tutorials and **check them in via Git**.  Or you can also edit tutorials using Github's UI.  **Way better than Wordpress**.
- If you aren't familiar with git/Github, or don't want to bother with that, that's fine too -- we have a handy-dandy visual editor on our site to edit tutorials right here.
- **The code for this site is open-sourced in Github**.  Let's improve it together!
- You can get your tutorials **peer-reviewed by others**.  This improves the quality of our collective knowledge.
- **Others can help maintain your tutorials long-term**, making the content have a much deeper longevity when updates are needed, and removes the original author as a single point of failure if you get busy and can't maintain your tutorial.
- **We can help each other reach a wide audience and make a bigger impact**.  When a tutorial gets published, we all work together to help promote it on HackerNews, to get lots of viewers.  By building momentum on this site together, we'll get a larger audience over time, which means your tutorials will reach a wide audience.
- (Future) **Bring knowledge to other countries**.  Your content can be translated by a community of bilingual and passionate about their countries receiving knowledge, to be shared with other countries who don't have a deep understanding of the English language.

### What types of tutorials are appropriate to post?

*Feel free to write about any technology that you're passionate about.* Generally speaking, one of the following:

* Tutorial on programming with X (where X is a technology or library you’re passionate about)
* Top 10 things you probably didn’t know about X
* Guide to what’s new in the latest version of X
* Advanced guide to programming with X
* Top 10 tips when programming with X
* X vs Y [where Y is a competing technology, or is no technology]

...or any other ideas you might have.  Please reach out to Prateek (prateek-gupta@pluralsight.com)! :)

### How long should tutorials be?

Tutorials/articles ideally range from 1500-3000 words, including `code blocks`, to be a 'definitive tutorial' on a technical subject.

### Can you help me edit/revise the article?
Yes! That's why we've built the editing tools on this site. It's easy to share a link to your article on social media and crowdsource expert-level editors for your topics. You'll be able to see suggestions from the community and accept the changes you want. Our editors can help improve it too.

### How do I know if my tutorial idea is any good?
One easy thing you can do is to check-out what else is out their for this particular subject. Try doing a quick search now for some topics that interest you. Other articles are generally OK so long as there is enough unique/useful content that sets your article apart. Are there ideas you can talk about in your proposed article that hasn't already been written? Enough interesting unique contributions that can be added that moves the world's knowledge forward? Those are some things to think about.
