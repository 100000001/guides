# The benefits of controlling your application layout with Redux

# Setup
 The examples  below will be done with [ng-boostrap]() since it's one of the most popular libraries with Angular 2 components for Bootstrap 4. However, you can also implement these examples with other component libraries such as [Material Design](https://github.com/angular/material2) by following the same design principles and making small adjustments to the code so that it works with the API of the corresponding library.
