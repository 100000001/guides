This tutorial uses the latest Ember CLI tool (v2.4.2).

### Install Ember CLI

The following `npm` command installs Ember CLI latest stable version in the global namespace. The latest Ember CLI version 2.4.2 is released on 1 of March 2016, it generates app with Ember.js v2.4 and Ember Data v2.4. (If you have an earlier version of Ember CLI, the following command automatically updates it to the latest.)

    $ npm install -g ember-cli
    
or if you would like to install with fixed version

    $ npm install -g ember-cli@2.4.2

You have now a new `ember` command in your console. Check with

    $ ember -v
    
You should see something similar:

``` bash {% raw %}
version: 2.4.2
node: 5.9.0
os: darwin x64{% endraw %}
```

(Node version, npm version and OS version may be different in your configuration.)
