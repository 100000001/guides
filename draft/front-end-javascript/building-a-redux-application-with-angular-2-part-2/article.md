# What we did last time

# Restructuring
 ### "Classifying" acitons
 
 - break down int odirs
 - create operation actions
 - implement in reducer
 - implement in component
 

 ** Actions **
 
 
 * For each action type in an action group, make a simple
 * enum object for all of this group's action types.
 

 //
 
 
 * Every action is comprised of at least a type and an optional
 * payload. Expressing actions as classes enables powerful 
 * type checking in reducer functions.
 
 ** Models **
 
 ** Reducers **
 
# Multiple states
- states
- reducers map

### Total change of the operations reducer
### Separating actions
### combineReducers and the metareducer

### Combining states
### Changing the app.module

# Getting state slices

# Effects

# UI State
