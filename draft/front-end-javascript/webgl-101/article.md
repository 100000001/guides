# What is WebGL?

[WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/) enables plugin-free 3D content on the web.
That means it is an interface between JavaScript and the OpenGL API, which is designed for high-performance 2D and 3D graphics.

# Setting up our environment

WebGL is using the [Canvas element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement) and its `getContext` method to provide access to the WebGL functionality, so as the very first thing, we'll need an HTML file with a canvas element inside:

```html
<!doctype html>
```

# Creating our first triangle

# Writing our first shaders

# Creating our first cube

# Rotating our cube

# Putting things into perspective
