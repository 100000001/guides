[Fanout](https://fanout.io/) is a great service that allows you to quickly and easily send messages to clients applications. In this tutorial we will use Fanout to send messages to an Ionic2 application.

### Getting Set Up

Next, while you are log into the the site nagivate to the [account page](https://fanout.io/account/panel/) and make a note of both your Reaml ID and your Realm Key - we will need both of these for wiring up the Ionic2 and Nodejs pub-sub mechanism. 

Next, to create an Ionic2 app that receive messages and the Nodejs app that publishes messages, you need to install Nodejs. Download and install it [here](https://nodejs.org/). 

Once the installation is complete, open a command prompt and execute:

```
npm install -g ionic@beta
```
This command will install the Ionic2 node package globally.
