[Fanout](https://fanout.io/) is a great service that allows you to quickly and easily send messages to clients applications. In this tutorial we will use Fanout to send messages to an Ionic2 application.

### Getting Set Up

Ok, first things first - to create an Ionic2 application and the Nodejs app that will create and send messages you need to install node. Download and install it [here](https://nodejs.org/). 

Next, open a command prompt and execute:

```
npm install -g ionic@beta
```
This command will install the Ionic2 node package globally. 

Then, go to the [Fanout](https://fanout.io/) site and create your FREE account.
