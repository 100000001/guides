This guide is aimed to provide a critical overview of two popular front-end web development tools - [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)  and [Angular 2](https://angular.io/). The tools will be evaluated based on their approaches to building applications, involvement and adoption by the community, performance and ability to integrate with different platforms.

# Key differences
 ### Structuring code
   Angular 2 is written in TypeScript, a superset language of JavaScript developed by Microsoft. The language introduced types, new data structures and more object-oriented features, making the code easier to read and maintain compared to other alternative.It uses [TSLint](http://palantir.github.io/tslint/) to check the code for issues.
   
   Using TypeScript makes setting up an Angular 2 application somehow tediuos, as it introduces extra overhead for configuration. 
   
   React is relying on JSX, a XML-esque syntax extension for rendering JavaScript and HTML. Syntax and strucutre-wise, JSX looks more familiar to JavaScript and apperas to blend into HTML more easily. It uses [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) to track for isses in the code.
   
   To get a clearer comparison between React and Angular 2, we are going to compare how a basic TODO application is built (example apps built by [Mark Volkmann (mvolkmann)](https://github.com/mvolkmann/react-examples).
