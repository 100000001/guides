In this guide, I will walk through how to build a simple store front that offers on-demand delivery. Since UberRUSH is currently only available in San Francisco, Chicago and New York City, the store will be based in Manhattan.

This application will be built using Ruby on Rails on the backend, an embedded Stripe from to simulate store checkout as well as an API wrapper for UberRUSH. For simple store setups, UberRUSH's API only has a few necessary endpoints. [Checkout the documentation here](https://developer.uber.com/docs/rush), it is through and easy to read.
