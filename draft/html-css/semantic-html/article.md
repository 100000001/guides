# Semantic HTML


There are many websites on the Internet. Most of them are made a long time ago and they are not updated with the latest HTML features. For that reason, they are not search engine friendly and they are not acessible for blind and visually impaired persons.

One of the most important features of the [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) is its **semantics**. It adds aditional information to basic html elements and makes a web page more informative and adaptable to search engines and [screen readers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader).

In this tutorial we will learn how to use new semantic HTML5 tags in a web page creation and how to check if we have done it successfully.

## Semantic HTML Page Layout

Let's first consider a basic HTML page layout, written in the basic (non-semantic) HTML:
``` HTML
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Example</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>
            Here goes logo, navigation, etc. 
        </div>
        <div>
            A place for website's main content 
        </div>
        <div>
            Footer information, links, etc.
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```
In the semantic HTML, the code should look like this:
``` HTML
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Example</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <header>
            Here goes logo, navigation, etc. 
        </header>
        <main>
            A place for website's main content 
        </main>
        <footer>
            Footer information, links, etc.
        </footer>
    </body>
</html
```
As you can notice, we have replaced *div* tags with 3 new tags: *header*, *main* and *footer*. Those tags are **semantic** and they are used to represent different sections on a HTML page. There are much more descriptive than *div* tags, since there is no doubt what parts of the HTML page are header and footer and where is the main content on the page.

## Navigation

In the HTML5, there is the *nav* tag, so we can use it instead of the *div* tag to wrap links which make a navigation menu. For instance, the navigation menu can be placed within the *header* section:

``` HTML
<header>
    <img src="logo.png" />
    <nav>
        <a href="index.html">Home</a>
        <a href="services.html">Services</a>
        <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
        <a href="about.html">About Us</a>            
    </nav> 
</header>
```
but, it can be placed outside of the *header* section, so this code is also valid:

``` HTML
<header>
    <img src="logo.png" />
</header>
<nav>
    <a href="index.html">Home</a>
    <a href="services.html">Services</a>
    <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
    <a href="about.html">About Us</a>            
</nav> 

```

## Main Content

We will add some content into the *main* section, as well. We will use new HTML5 tags for that purpose, *article* and *section*, so the main content will, for instance, have the following structure:

``` HTML
<main>
    <article>
        <h1>News</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Headline 1</h2>
            <p>Text...</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Headline 2</h2>
            <p>Text...</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Headline 3</h2>
            <p>Text...</p>
        </section>        
    </article>
</main>
```
The *article* tag is used for wrapping an autonomous content on a page, i.e. content which can be removed from the page and put on another place. It can contain several *section* tags, like in our example. The *section* tag is similar to the *div* tag, but it is more meaningful, since it is used to wrap a logical group of related content (e.g. a chapter of an article). The *article* tag is actually the *section* tag for an independent content. So, it's not mistake to use the *section* for such content, but it's much better to use the *article* because it is more meaningful.

If you are unsure which semantic tag to use in a particular case, you can always follow this great flowchart made by authors of the [HTML5Doctor](http://html5doctor.com) website.
