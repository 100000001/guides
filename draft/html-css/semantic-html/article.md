# Introduction

There are over 1 billion websites on the Internet. A large number of them are made a long time ago and they are not updated with the latest HTML features. For that reason, they are not search engine friendly and they are not acessible for blind and visually impaired persons.

One of the most important features of the [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) is its **semantics**. It adds aditional information to basic html elements and makes a web page more informative and adaptable to search engines and [screen readers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader).

In this tutorial we will learn how to use new semantic HTML5 tags in a web page creation and how to check if we used them successfully.

# Semantic HTML Page Layout
## Basic HTML Page Structure
Let's first consider a basic HTML page structure, written in the basic (non-semantic) HTML:
``` HTML
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Example</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="header">
            Here goes logo, navigation, etc. 
        </div>
        <div id="main-content">
            A place for website's main content 
        </div>
        <div id="footer">
            Footer information, links, etc.
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```
In the semantic HTML, the code above should look like this:
``` HTML
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Example</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <header>
            Here goes logo, navigation, etc. 
        </header>
        <main>
            A place for website's main content 
        </main>
        <footer>
            Footer information, links, etc.
        </footer>
    </body>
</html
```
As you can notice, we have replaced *div* tags with 3 new tags: *header*, *main* and *footer*. Those tags are **semantic** and they are used to represent different sections on a HTML page. There are much more descriptive than *div* tags, since there is no doubt what parts of the HTML page are header and footer and where is the main content on the page.

## Navigation

In the HTML5, there is the *nav* tag, so we can use it instead of the *div* tag to wrap links that make a navigation menu. For instance, the navigation menu can be put within the *header* section:

``` HTML
<header>
    <img src="logo.png" />
    <nav>
        <a href="index.html">Home</a>
        <a href="services.html">Services</a>
        <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
        <a href="about.html">About Us</a>            
    </nav> 
</header>
```
but, it can be put after the *header* section, as well:

``` HTML
<header>
    <img src="logo.png" />
</header>
<nav>
    <a href="index.html">Home</a>
    <a href="services.html">Services</a>
    <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
    <a href="about.html">About Us</a>            
</nav> 

```
Generally, the navigation menu can be put anywhere on a page, it just needs to be wrap it with the *nav* tag. However, it shouldn't be inside of the *main* tab, unless the navigation is specific for that page, because the *main* tag is intended to contain a content that is specific for a particular page. 

## Main Content

In order to add some content into the *main* section, we need to use new HTML5 tags for that purpose, *article* and *section*, so the main content could, for instance, have the following structure:

``` HTML
<main>
    <article>
        <h1>News</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Headline 1</h2>
            <p>Text...</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Headline 2</h2>
            <p>Text...</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Headline 3</h2>
            <p>Text...</p>
        </section>        
    </article>
</main>
```
The *article* tag is used for wrapping an autonomous content on a page, i.e. content that can be removed from the page and put on some another page. It can contain several *section* tags, like in our example. The *section* tag is similar to the *div* tag, but it is more meaningful, since it is used to wrap a logical group of related content (e.g. a chapter of an article). The *section* tag can be also used to wrap the article, but it's much better to use the *article* tag for that purpose, since it is more appropriate and more descriptive. An *article* is actually an autonomous *section*.

## Additional Content

An additional content, that is not important for understanding an article, but it is related to the article, can be put inside the *aside* tag. For instance, it could be information about how many people read that article, who is the author of the article etc. In that case, the HTML code of the article could have the following structure:

``` HTML
<main>
    <article>
        <h1>News</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Headline 1</h2>
            <p>Text...</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Headline 2</h2>
            <p>Text...</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Headline 3</h2>
            <p>Text...</p>
        </section>
        <aside>

        </aside>
    </article>
</main>
```

The *aside* tag can be also used to enclose an additional content that is related to a whole page, not just to a particular article. That content can be a sidebar, advertising, footnote etc.

The *figure* tag is used to mark up photos, code blocks, diagrams, charts, illustrations etc. Generally, it encloses a content that can be moved away into an appendix. Some images should be enclosed with the *figure* tag (e.g. a logo image), but banner ads shouldn't, since they are not related to the main content of the page. If a banner ad is in a sidebar, it shouldn't be inside of the *aside* tag, for the same reason. However, there is a way to mark up a banner ad and we will cover that in the Microdata section of this tutorial.
