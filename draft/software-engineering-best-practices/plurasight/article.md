# A guide to be a better developer

Before we jump into the topic let me introduce who a software developer really is?

###### A software engineer is a person who applies the principles of software engineering to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of the software and systems that make computers or anything containing software work.

Now that you know who a software engineer is, let us see what are the principles of software engineering that is mentioned in the above definition.

* Focus on producing high quality
* Determine the problem
* Evaluate design alternatives
* Use an appropriate process model
* Minimize the intellectual distance between the developer and use
* Good management is better than good technology
* People are the key to success
* Follow with care
* Give products to customer early

Before we jump in to see "How a software developer can apply these basic principles to build a better software"? Lets understand what a Software Development Life Cycle is?

### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

###### Software Development cycle is a well defined, structured sequence of stages intended to develop a software product

The stages of SDLC include:

* Feasible study
* Requirements analysis and specification
* Design
* Coding
* Testing
* Maintenance

### How a software developer can apply these basic principles to build a better software?

##### Intro here

#### Feasible study

The main of "Feasiblity Study" is to determine whelther the product is financially worthwhile and "Technically feasible".

The focus of this stage should be on:
* Understand the problem
* Plan out different solutions
* Perform a financial analysis(cost & benefit)

#### Requirement analysis and specification

The aim of this stage should be on understanding the exact requirements of the customer and document them properly.

The focus of this stage should be on:
* Collect all the related data from the customer through interviews and discussions to clearly understand what the customer really wants. Ensure correctness, consistency and unambiguity in the requirements.
* Organise the requirements in a "Software Requirements Specification" document.

#### Design

The design phase transforms requirements specification in a form suitable for implementation in some programming language.

High-level design:
* Decompose the system into modules
* represent invocation relationships between modules

Detailed design:
* Different modules are designed in greater detail. For example, data structures and algorithms for each module are designed.

#### Coding

During the implementation phase each module of design is coded and each module is unit tested.
The purpose of unit testing is to test if individual modules work correctly. The end product of implementation phase is a set of program modules that have been tested individually.


#### Testing

In this stage different modules are integrated in a planned manner. During each integration step the partially integrated system is tested. After all the modules have been successfully integrated and tested, system testing is carried out. The goal of system testing is to ensure that the developed system functions according to its requirements specified in the SRS document.

#### Maintenance

The maintenance of any software product requires more efffort than to develop the product itself. Development effort to Maintenance effort ratio is typically 2:3.

The main focus of this stage is to:
* Making appropriate changes to prevent the occurence of errors
* Correct errors which were not discovered during the product development phase.
* Improve implementation of the system
* Enchance functionalities of the system
* Port software to new environment
