### **Lets get started thinking about availability**

> *Availability of a system is typically measured as a factor of its reliability â€“ as reliability increases, so does availability. - Wikipedia*

This word is very important when the most important thing is offer a reliable system.  But, how to offer that kind of system, how can I create something that makes me feel confortable.

------------------------

### Features of a reliable system

* Always available
* A huge suite of test cases
* Integrated diagnostic tools
* Real time monitoring
* Restrict access from external clients
* **Log every error in real time**

### Log every error in real time

At this point I want to explain why log your program is an important task when you deliver an app to a production environment.  

Logging allows you to know more about the behaviour and performance of your app to take decisions and provide the neccesary fixes to solve a problem.  Likewise, logging provides you information about the broken point of your app.

Nowdays to check the results of a logging process is very hard because every log resides either into a server, virtualization, virtual server or cloud services.
