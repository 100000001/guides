I have a fish tank and I want to go on a vacation and need to feed the fish or sometimes I keep forgetting to feed them regularly or I 'm just too lazy to feed the fish but i don't want to see dead skeletons in my fish tank :D so from time to time i have to interrupt whatever i am doing and go to feed the fish twice a day everyday ...... why they just don't feed themselves :D so i came up with this idea i will make them feed themselves and guess want i won't touch the fish tank unless once a week to fill the food .

Magical , isn't it :D ? also i can control the fish tank lights remotely .
## How it Works
Thanks to this guy in the picture i call him "Mr Feeder"
and yes he 's a plastic cup with some decorations i made for him to look like a fish (i assume) :D .
