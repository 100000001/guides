Semantic HTML's primary purpose is to provide both meaning and structure. 
Why write semantic HTML? There are a lot of benefits including, more readable and efficient code. It makes it easier for web crawlers and assistive devices/software to understand the structure of your webpage, which makes it more accessible. The structure of a web page is called the Document Outline.

The most important 
header, hgroup, nav, article, figure, figcaption, time, section, aside, and footer elements

A ```
div
``` tag does not have any semantic meaning, and does not add any structure to your page.

A ```
section
``` tag can be named by placing a ```
header
``` tag (h1-h6) directly inside of it.
Many sections can have both a ```
header
``` and a ```
footer
```, but you can't put them inside of each other.
