## 2016 hack.guides() Authoring Contest

We are excited to launch hack.guides() authoring contest where developers around the world will share their experience & best practices by authoring tutorials on any technology you're passionate in!

The hack.guides() authoring contest is unique, and brings the developer community together to create and curate collaborative content. With the Github API on backend, hack.guides() tutorials can be forked, improved, and merged just as simple as a pull request.

## Why we are doing this

We want to be "wikipedia" for technical tutorials,and guides currently exist in silos. They live on individual blogs, and are fragmented and varying in quality. Those guides don't typically reach a wide audience since individual blogs have limited reach.

Once a guide is created, it becomes stale and out of date. If the author doesn’t maintain their content, then it becomes less useful. There isn’t a strong way for developers to improve their content through peer review. 

>Wordpress isn't great for that.

### We love Open-Source

*The tutorials on this site are open-sourced on Github, which many developers use daily and love.*

We use MarkDown (rather than WordPress), a simple file format. This is a really simple text-based file format that takes around 60 seconds to understand. It's really easy to make things bold, italics, code blocks, etc. Markdown is used in many places, such as Github README files. Even this file is a Markdown file. You can help us edit and improve it.

### Guidelines and suggestions for posts/topics

Feel free to write about any technology that you're passionate about. Generally speaking, one of the following:

- Tutorial on programming with X (where X is a technology or library you’re passionate about)
- Top 10 things you probably didn’t know about X
- Guide to what’s new in the latest version of X
- Advanced guide to programming with X
- Top 10 tips when programming with X
- X vs Y [where Y is a competing technology or is no technology]
...or any other ideas you might have. 

Tutorials/articles ideally range from 1500-3000 words, including code blocks, to be a 'definitive guide' on a technical subject.
