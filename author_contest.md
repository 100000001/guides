![Authoring Contest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluralsight/guides/master/images/a76c7abd-8c17-43c6-a639-e3e55e3a774f.png)


We are excited to launch the hack.guides() authoring contest where developers around the world will share their experience & best practices by authoring tutorials on any technology you're passionate in!

The hack.guides() authoring contest is unique, and brings the developer community together to create and curate collaborative content. With the Github API on backend, hack.guides() tutorials can be forked, improved, and merged just as simple as a pull request.

## Be an Author

Submit your new tutorial to qualify for a chance to win cash prizes (gift cards) from our sponsors, and build your brand by teaching new and interesting API, and best practices. This is a great way to contribute and give back to the developer community.

## Why we are doing this

Our collective aim is working together to educate the world while improving our knowledge at the same time. Think of this as a "Wikipedia" for technical guides and tutorials, or "Medium.com for developers" as another analogy.

>We love Open-Source

*The tutorials on this site are open-sourced on Github, which many developers use daily and love.*

We use MarkDown (rather than WordPress), a simple file format. This is a really simple text-based file format that takes around 60 seconds to understand. It's really easy to make things bold, italics, code blocks, etc. Markdown is used in many places, such as Github README files. Even this file is a Markdown file. You can help us edit and improve it.

- Top 10 things you probably didn’t know about X
- Guide to what’s new in the latest version of X
- Advanced guide to programming with X
- Top 10 tips when programming with X
- X vs Y [where Y is a competing technology or is no technology]
...or any other ideas you might have. 

Tutorials/articles ideally range from 1500-3000 words, including code blocks, to be a 'definitive guide' on a technical subject.
