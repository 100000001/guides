## Getting started with all the power of ASP.net MVC Core 1.0

Detail:
This is going to be my first tutorial written in English, so if you find a bug in my spelling system I will appreciate you report it to me!
Well, first we need to accept the terms and conditions in order to continue with this tutorial:

1.  Focus your attention first on this tutorial and after you complete it you will create it by your own.
2.  The tools we need are: Visual Studio Community Edition 2015 (Later on I would like to achieve this using Visual Studio Code).
3.  On Visual Studio CE 2015, install Web Essential Extension (This is very powerful).
4.  This is just the starting point, promise with yourself to expand, keep this in mind: Today I will better than yesterday and tomorrow better than today.
5.  Say this to yourself: I am going to help more people interested on this topic as the same way the author does with me.

Ok! perfect! Once you accepted this Terms and Conditions, let's rock!

This is the idea:
--------------------------
* Overview about MVC Pattern.
* Create a simple project from scratch (No validation).
* Add MVC support.
* Add CRUD operations.
* Playing with action filters.
* Create a custom helper to increase our productivity.
* Add Sessions.
* Store the data on a database.
* Add Identity : This will take care about users, logins, roles, claims. 
* Deploy the project to a Local IIS.

## Overview about MVC Pattern.
This is not new, according to the story and thanks to Wikipedia the concept of MVC comes from 1970s... 

## Creating the project
* We need to have ASP.net MVC RC2 Tooling.
* This new framework is very modular, as you advance you install only what you need.


## Add MVC Support
