## Angular 2.0 is finally Here! Well, Almost
At the end of the year, Angular's dev team was happy to announce that [Angular 2.0 was officially in beta](http://bit.ly/1Lw7K7S). This means that although it may not be ready for production, the core concepts that the framework was built upon are not going too change, at least not significantly, so those who plan to use Angular 2.0 can now begin to learn about its different features without having to worry about them becoming obsolete. In turn, I decided to create this guide dedicated towards bringing developers up to speed with the new features of ng2 and how the framework works altogether. 

Specifically, this guide aims to provide readers with knowledge regarding the following areas of Angular 2.0, and how they differ from ng1.

* Events in Angular
* Modules 
* Template Syntax
* Components vs. Directives
* Client Side Routing
* Resources for getting started
